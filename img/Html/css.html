The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It is the fifth largest satellite
      in the Solar System and the largest and most massive relative to its parent
      planet,[f] with a diameter about one-quarter that of Earth (comparable to the
      width of Australia).[16] The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated
      rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the
      term and larger than all known dwarf planets of the Solar System.[17] It lacks any
      significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about
      one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 g, with Jupiter's moon Io being the only satellite in
      the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.

The Moon orbits Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi),
      or about 30 times Earth's diameter. Its gravitational influence is
      the main driver of Earth's tides and very slowly lengthens Earth's
      day. The Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days. During
      each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface illuminated
      by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar phases that form
      the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. The Moon is tidally locked to
      Earth, which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own
      axis causes its same side (the near side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat
      longer lunar day is the same as the synodic period. However, 59% of the total lunar
      surface can be seen from Earth through cyclical shifts in perspective known as libration.

      the total lunar surface can be seen from
      Earth through cyclical shifts in perspective known as libration. <i style="color:blue">The most widely accepted origin explanation posits that the
      Moon formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth,
      out of the debris from a giant impact between the planet
      and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia. It then receded to a wider
      orbit because of tidal interaction with the Earth. The near side of the Moon
      is marked by dark volcanic maria ("seas"), which fill the spaces between
      bright ancient crustal highlands and prominent impact craters. Most of
      the large impact basins and mare surfaces were in place by the end of the
      Imbrian period, some three billion years ago. The lunar surface is fairly
      non-reflective, with the reflectance of lunar soil being comparable to that
      of asphalt. However, due to its large angular diameter, the full moon is the
      brightest celestial object in the night sky. The Moon's apparent size is nearly
      the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun almost completely during a
      total solar eclipse.</i>

Both the Moon's prominence in Earth's sky and its regular cycle of phases
      have provided cultural references and influences for human societies
      throughout history. Such influences can be found in language, calendar <b>The first artificial object to reach the
      Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 uncrewed spacecraft in 1959; this
      was followed by the first successful soft landing by Luna 9 in 1966.</b>
      systems, art, and mythology.
      The only human lunar missions to date have been those of the United States'
      Apollo program, which landed twelve men on the surface between 1969 and 1972.
      These and later uncrewed missions returned lunar rocks that have been used to
      develop a detailed geological understanding of the Moon's origins,
      internal structure, and subsequent history. </p>
